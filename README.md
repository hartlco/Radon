# Radon CloudKit Syncing
Radon CloudKit Sync provides a way to synchronise a model of an Application with the Apple CloudKit backend. Radon is only concerned with the synchronisation part and requires the implementation of two protocols that handle the individual the access to the used model and database layer in the App.

Radon is still a work in progress. Currently it handles synchronisation of every model class separately. Relationships need to be handled by the developer itself.
